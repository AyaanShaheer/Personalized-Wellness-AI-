2. **Run all cells sequentially**
3. **Review visualizations and evaluation results**
4. **Modify parameters for experimentation**

---

## 📈 **Results Summary**

### 🧠 Model Performance

* **Mood Prediction RMSE**: < 1.0 (on 1–10 scale)
* **Classification Accuracy**: > 85%
* **Clustering Silhouette Score**: Optimal grouping achieved
* **Cross-Validation**: Stable generalization

### 🔍 Key Insights

* Sleep duration is the strongest predictor of mood
* Higher physical activity reduces stress
* Excessive screen time impairs sleep
* Social interactions enhance mood and wellness

 

---

## 📊 **Visualizations Generated**

* Sleep vs Mood Correlation
* Activity vs Stress Relationship
* Mood Distribution
* Screen Time vs Sleep Impact
* Actual vs Predicted Mood
* Feature Importance Charts
* PCA Plot of Clustering Results

---

## ✅ **Q3: Evaluation Strategy**

### 🎯 Goal

To assess how accurately our models predict mood from lifestyle indicators.

### 📏 Metrics Used

* **RMSE**: Measures average prediction error magnitude
* **R² Score**: Explains variance in mood explained by the model

These metrics suit wellness data where subtle differences in mood have practical importance.

### 🧪 Validation Strategy

* **Train-Test Split (80/20)** for initial evaluation
* Considered adding **K-Fold Cross-Validation** for future work

### 🔁 Future Improvements

* K-Fold for generalization
* Group-based evaluation (e.g., sedentary vs. active users)
* Chronological validation if using real user timelines
* Error analysis for outlier detection and model refinement

---

## 🔄 **Q5: Challenges & Growth**

### ❗ Key Challenge

Creating synthetic data that’s realistic, interpretable, and useful for learning without overcomplication.

### 🛠️ How It Was Solved

* Used domain knowledge for feature selection
* Balanced contributions using weighted formulas
* Introduced noise and clipping for realism
* Visual validation via scatterplots and distributions

### 🌱 Personal Growth

* Improved understanding of the ML lifecycle
* Sharpened trade-off decision-making (accuracy vs interpretability)
* Boosted interest in human-centric AI and mental wellness
* Learned how ethical considerations influence technical design

---

## 🔐 **Ethical Considerations**

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

* 100% synthetic data (no real PII)
* Local-only recommendation engine

### ⚖️ Bias & Fairness

* Simulated diverse behavior in data generation
* Awareness of potential feature bias

### 🛟 Safety

* Clear disclaimers on limitations
* Suggestion to seek human guidance for sensitive health issues

---

## 🚧 **Limitations & Future Work**

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

* Synthetic data lacks long-term trends and real-life noise
* No tracking of user over time (no time-series)
* Excludes external contextual factors (e.g., illness, events)

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Add longitudinal tracking
* Deploy as a REST API with secure endpoints
* Integrate user feedback loop
* Explore LLM-based personalized coaching
* Add real-user pilot study with opt-in consent
